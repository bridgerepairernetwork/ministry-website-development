If migrating from Vercel Blob to Cloudinary, remove `@vercel/blob` and install the Cloudinary SDK:

```

Run in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The admin UI is available at `/admin`.

## Cloudinary Notes

- Images are uploaded to the `gallery` folder in your Cloudinary account.
- The server returns both the secure URL and the `publicId` which is stored in Firestore.
- Deleting a gallery item removes the image from Cloudinary using the `publicId`.
